# ASSESSMENT 5: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure you are progressing in your professional development.

### Portfolios

Deploying a project is an exciting, yet often challenging process. There are usually small errors that cause deployments to fail or cause bugs in production. One solution to this is to deploy early and update the deployment as the code evolves.

Submit the link to your deployed portfolio site:

We recommend GitHub pages for HTML/CSS and Render.com for React. Your portfolio site should display AT LEAST "Hello World" text. Completely blank sites will be considered incomplete. 

### LinkedIn

Your LinkedIn url:

Check the boxes below to certify that you have completed the following items on LinkedIn:

- [ ] create a new post about your first five weeks at LEARN. Topics can include (but are not limited to) Ruby, sharing a project you created, sharing a resource you found helpful, or portfolios.
- [ ] add at least ten more professional connections. You should have at least 50 LinkedIn connections.
- [ ] react (like, celebrate, comment, etc) to ten posts.
